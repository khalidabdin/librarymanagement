        To change the font size on the Chrome browser follow the following steps. Click on the Spanner menu icon at the top right or press Shift + Alt + T to access the toolbar, then press the right arrow key until 'Customise and control Google Chrome' is highlighted, and then press Enter. Click on 'Options' in the drop-down menu or press O. In the 'Google Chrome Options' window, click the 'Under the Bonnet' tab (it's called 'Under the Hood' in US English versions). Alternatively, press Tab if necessary until one of the tabs is highlighted, then use the left and right arrow keys to cycle through the tabs until 'Under the Bonnet' is selected. Click on the 'Change font and language settings' button (you may need to scroll down to see it). This window does not have a keyboard-friendly alternative: you will need to press Tab and check whether you can then use the down arrow key to scroll down. If not, repeat until you are able to use the down arrow key. Scroll down until you can see the 'Change font and language settings' button, then press Tab repeatedly until the button is highlighted and then press Enter. Choose the fonts for all web pages you visit In the 'Fonts and Languages' window, select the 'Fonts and Encoding' tab. Click the 'Change' button beside the font style you wish to change (Serif Font, Sans-Serif Font or Fixed-width Font), or press Tab until it is highlighted and then press Enter. In the 'Font' window, click to select the font name, style and size you want. Alternatively, navigate by pressing Tab or by pressing Alt + F to select 'Font', Alt + Y to select 'Font style' and Alt + S to select 'Size'. Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the font options as required. When you are satisfied with your font options, click the 'OK' button, or press Tab until it is highlighted and then press Enter. This returns you to the 'Fonts and Languages' window, where you can repeat the steps for the other font types, if desired. Otherwise, click the 'OK' button, or press Tab until it is highlighted and then press Enter, to return to the 'Google Chrome Options' window. Click the 'Close' button, or press Tab until it is highlighted and then press Enter, to finish and return to Google Chrome.

        American Sign Language, also known by the abbreviation ASL, is the language used by more by numerous deaf people in the Canada. Currently, there are not many sites that offer ASL as a communications medium. However, one example is the Canadian Hearing Society, an organisation that promotes sign language and deaf issues. They provide information in BSL using Flash technology. Another is ITV's Signed Stories, in which storybooks for children are read out in BSL (along with subtitles). As the use of broadband increases and signing technology develops, there will undoubtedly be more web resources for ASL users.
